# James Baldwin in the World Bot

This [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/TweetsNativeSon) programmatically retweets references to "James Baldwin" from across Twitter a few times each day. It offers a glimpse into how the late novelist James Baldwin is being discussed, debated, and conjured in the contemporary world.

Because I do not wish to expose anyone to potentially unwanted public scrutiny, I programmed the bot to only retweet tweets that have more than 100 retweets or that were tweeted by Twitter accounts with more than 10,000 followers.
